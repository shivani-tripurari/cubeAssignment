# Cube — Frontend Implementation💻🚀

This project is a responsive, pixel-accurate implementation of the GTG Perfumes product page based on the provided Figma design. The objective was to replicate the layout and interactions using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, while ensuring clean code structure and strong performance.

## Features

### Pixel-Perfect UI
- The interface closely follows the provided Figma design, including typography, spacing, color system, and component structures.
- Sections implemented: hero, product gallery, subscription plans, collection accordion, metrics, comparison table, and footer.

### Responsive Design
- Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.
- Navigation converts to a hamburger menu with a full-width dropdown on smaller screens.
- Product layout transitions to a stacked format for improved readability on mobile.

### Functional Components
- **Product Gallery:** Thumbnail selection, next/prev controls, and dynamic dot indicators.
- **Subscription Logic:** Expandable panels with radio-based selection; dynamically generates corresponding "Add to Cart" URLs.
- **Accordion Component:** Built with JavaScript; collapsible content blocks for the collection section.
- **Metrics Counter:** Numbers animate from 0 to the target value upon entering the viewport.

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading:** Images load only when approaching the viewport, reducing initial load time.
- **Lightweight Animations:** CSS transitions and efficient JavaScript ensure smooth, non-blocking interactions.

## Summary

This implementation demonstrates the ability to:
- Recreate a complex page with pixel perfect accuracy.
- Build interactive components without libraries or frameworks.
- Apply responsive design principles effectively.
- Optimize load performance through lazy loading and lightweight animations.
